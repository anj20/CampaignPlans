## Site

## Inspiration
People usually avoid their health. These campaigns will make them aware. Further these are organised on weekends so it will give a break.
## What it does
It contains a set of campaigns. Audience can participate or fund a campaign if they like. Further, they can add a campaign of their own choice and ask the user to fund.
## How we built it
Built using solidity and vite framework.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into problem while deploying the smart contracts. Further, also connecting smart contract with the front end was also challenging.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Proud to deploy the smart contract.
## What we learned
I have learn vite framework.
## What's next for New Year Campaigns Plans
Since there was time constraints so I can't add much features. I am thinking to add a vote poll so that the campaign getting much votes will remain at the top.
